This Algorithm finds the sum of the perimter values of a given m*n matrix

This is a very simple java algorithm to find the Sum of the perimeter values of any m*n matrix

This algorithm has to simple steps.

1. First what we do is simply find the sum of the top and bottom row's of the given matrix
2. Second what we do is simply find the sum of the first and last column of the given matrix. here to eliminate the values from the top and bottom rows last column we simply check for the column's when not checking for the row's.
